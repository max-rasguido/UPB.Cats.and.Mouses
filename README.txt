Cats & Mouse game


This project intends to create a game based in automatons.
The game is suposed to be played on a Chess board in which 4 cats are placed on one side and a mouse on the other, the moves are checkers like allowing the cats only to move forward diagonaly and the mouse to move also diagonaly but forward and backwards.
The game is won when the cats trap the mouse (not allowing it to move any longer) or the mouse pass the cats (where he can no longer be catched).
